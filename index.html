                </header>
                <p>Since I was a child, I wanted to be a matematician. Use huge computers and program in FORTRAN.
                    But I grown up and met JavaScript - the contestation of programming languages. A new era began.
                </p>
                <p>I am an infinite learner, tester, writer. You will often find me digging internet
                    searching for new apps, libraries or frameworks to read about and test.
                    I am also a fan of FOSS, the idea, the software, the community. All the good things that makes me
                    belive in people.
                </p>
                <p>I use VSCode for most of my jobs because it's super handy but I am also learning and configuring own
                    Vim
                    setup. I love experiments and I heard a lot of good things about how great this tool can be.
                    In the past I used to work pretty much in Adobe CS (PS, Illustrator, After Effects) but currently my
                    main and beloved graphic tool is Figma. It's neat for sketches and prototypes that sometimes I need
                    to prepare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to help others, really, so I started a World Wide Developers project. A small group of
                    enthusiasts helping
                    non-profit organizations with admin and development tasks that they cannot afford by themselves.

                        <div>I joined swiss technology company - zetcom. It has a great and awarded software for
                            managing art collections for museums and galleries. I joined to lead a project
                            which is going to upgrade the company stack when it comes to publication online (some art
                            collections are being publicly available to view).
                            I am also a support person for the company REST API and change requests that are comming for
                            the legacy Java application. Besides that, I am running current company website and

                            The company has crowdlending marketplace application as a main product and few
                            innovative ideas in the area of financing local businesses. I was the all-in-one for the front of company
                            digital being. I was working on branding materials
                            for print and web, design and implementation of company website, some marketing tasks like
                            newsletters, A/B tests, playing with Google Tag

                        <div>During my time as a banker I started experiments with graphic design. I spent nights on
                            polishing Photoshop
                            and Illustrator skills. Did few animations in Flash, made some banners in After Effects and
                            even (award winning)
                            short movie mastered entirely in Premiere. Also, back in then I met fractals and variety of
                            apps that allow me to render
                            this beautiful piece of math. I am rendering them till today. After some time of playing
                            with random graphics
                            I was asked to prepare a concept for a website. I think that this was a very beginning of
                            the way to full time
                            web developer.

                        <div>I have started as an analyst in a big financial institution - british RBS. This was my
                            first real job and
                            a great experience. I had to investigate billion dollar payments, link connections between
                            involved parties, fix broken elements, and count every minute as a loss. After few years I
                            moved to another
                            bank - Citi - to gain some new skills, but back in then I already knew that this is not my
                            way.
                            Well, it was, but in a different manner - in the second place I met my wonderful wife.
